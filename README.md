Overview of the project
project:simple calculator of any two numbers

Objective:

The objective of the simple calculator program is to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers entered by the user and display the result accurately.

Key Activities:

User Input: Accept input from the user for two numbers and the operation they want to perform.
Arithmetic Operations:
Addition: Sum the two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtract the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiply the two numbers.
Division: Divide the first number by the second (handle division by zero gracefully).
Display Result: Show the result of the arithmetic operation to the user.
Error Handling: Handle potential errors such as invalid inputs (non-numeric inputs) or division by zero.
User Interaction: Allow the user to perform multiple calculations sequentially if desired.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Typically, this could be implemented in languages like Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, etc.
User Interface (UI): For a simple console-based calculator, basic input/output functions are used.
Data Handling: Basic data types and operations are sufficient (integers, floating-point numbers).
Error Handling: Conditionals and exception handling (where applicable) to manage errors gracefully.
Development Tools: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Eclipse, etc., for writing and debugging code.
